## Buidling an application using React, GraphQL and AWSApp Sync

I got started with AWS Amplify just the other day. This application follows an idea from a workshop video by Nader Dabit.
Although at some point i descided to use a different approach and add abit more functionalities. My key focus in documenting this will be on GraphQL

### What I have implemented.

- Fetching data
- Fetching sorted data
- Adding data from the UI (Made using React)
- Updating data
- Deleting data

The logic can be applied for any crud application you'd like to make, in my case the data is for confrences to be held.
